## Contributing

This site is built with [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `docs`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, Node.js `v18` or higher and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) `v9` or higher are required:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

## Working on the content

- See VitePress docs on supported [Markdown Extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown).

- We adopt the same [Writing Guide](https://github.com/vuejs/docs/blob/main/.github/contributing/writing-guide.md) as Vue.js for rules and recommendations on writing and maintaining documentation content.
