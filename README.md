# ðŸ“„ Documentation for Fleet SDK

[Fleet SDK](https://github.com/fleet-sdk/fleet) is an easy-to-use, modular, and extensible off-chain code SDK (Software Development Kit)for the [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/), written entirely in TypeScript.

**Fleet SDK** is currently in alpha status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box use, but the API may still change between minor releases.
